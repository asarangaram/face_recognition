    """
    Align and crop the face from the image based on the given landmarks.

    Args:
        img (np.ndarray): The full image (not the cropped bounding box). This image will be transformed.
        landmarks (List[np.ndarray]): List of 5 keypoints (landmarks) as (x, y) coordinates. These keypoints typically include the eyes, nose, and mouth.
        image_size (int, optional): The size to which the image should be resized. Defaults to 112. It is typically either 112 or 128 for face recognition models.

    Returns:
        Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: The aligned face image and the transformation matrix.
